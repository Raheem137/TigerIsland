In order to run successfully, you must do the following

1. Set the IP Address variable in the Tournament Configuration Block in client.java to your devices IP Address

2. Run server.java first

3. Run main.java while server.java is running

A few kinks I am working out: 

-The server can only handle the messages consecutively if there is a 1-10 millisecond delay between them

-For testing purposes only, sending a message to the server and listening to the server only work if they are in two different classes

If you see anything else, please let me know. I believe the server caused most groups to crash and burn last year, and I don’t want to be lynched because mine didn’t work
